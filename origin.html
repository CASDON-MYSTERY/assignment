                    Various types of efforts on the socio-economy of workers at the small and medium industry (SMI) levels have been made. However, attention to the handicraft sector is limited. For the most part, handicraft exhibitions are only more focused on manufacturing
                    industry workers and public institutions in peninsular Malaysia who have contributed to the socio-economic status differences among them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea to implement this Dastar exhibition is because it introduces the industrial sector based on woven handicrafts that are mostly found in Malaysian society. Therefore, for the Borneo archipelago community, namely in the state of Sabah, the majority
                    who carry out weaving activities include the majority of the Bajau and Rungus. This is because in the past, weaving activities were a very important job to learn especially for women due to their production as their own use.

                <p>
                    Therefore, based on this proposal, the exhibition to be done is to find out the art of Dastar weaving handicrafts that are informed that the work of the people is really pioneered by the ethnicity and aims to give more serious attention to the development
                    of social and economic status for industry players. This is because their contribution to the handicraft sector in Malaysia has received a lot of attention in realizing the scope of tourism and uniqueness found in this country.

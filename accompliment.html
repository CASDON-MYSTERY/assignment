                    This exhibition can showcase Dastar weaving handicrafts that some people do not know about the existence of the product until its production has been recognized. In fact, the exhibition conducted aims to describe the processes of weaving production from
                    raw materials that have not been treated until it becomes a product that is ready to be marketed. What we are trying to highlight in the exhibition is how the level of production of handicraft products is stated with the value required
                    in motivating oneself until the product is fully ready. In addition, in any enterprise there must be problems that will allow entrepreneurs to learn from the constraints faced in further developing the existing industry.
